# üî¥ Portal

Portal aims to be a central information hub for hackers which will contain important information about the hackathon

## üñºÔ∏è big picture

We hope for Portal to

- relay important time sensitive information like announcements
- contain a schedule detailing the events happening during a hackathon which can be updated through a CMS
- provide a convenient way to access useful links and resources. e.g.
  - the slack/discord workspace
  - hacker package / slides / prize info
  - devpost
- be reusable across different hackathons
