## Writing/reviewing pull requests üì•
To make changes to the main branch in an organized and clean manner, it's good practice to request such changes through a [pull request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

If there's anything in the review process that you think we can improve, please let us know!

### Writing pull requests üìù
When you create a pull request there will be a template that you can follow - this is a guide for what content you should include. Pull requests provide context and reasoning to changes, and your main goal is to describe what your code can't by itself. Things to keep in mind:
- keep writing and explanations concise
- explain concepts/terminology that might not be familiar to reviewers
- as an author, be receptive to comments and feedback
- watch your merge build to make sure it is successful
- notify codeowners if issues arise
- delete your branch after merging

### Reviewing pull requests üëÄ
Pull requests require an approving review from a contributor with write access before they can pushed up to the main branch. If you're unsure of who you should ask for a review you can ask the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS).

Reviewing is also a great way to learn about the codebase, learn what others are working on, and improve your own coding practices!

As a reviewer:
- clearly outline your changes/suggestions
- review and follow up on subsequent changes in a timely manner to keep pull requests from going stale
