          Weâ€™re excited to have you join us January 20-21, 2024 for a 24-hour long hackathon filled
          with workshops and exciting new events. This year, weâ€™re also giving you the opportunity
          to showcase your project live in front of a panel of judges and hundreds of hackers from
          around North America! We focus on creating a quality hackathon experience all of our
          attendees, so please fill out the form so we can get a better idea of the amount of people
          attending, and of course, craft the best 24-hour hacker experience for you!
